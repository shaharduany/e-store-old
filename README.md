# EShop Project

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This project is a single-page ecommerce-shop with a React front and Node.js back, MongoDB noSQL database.

## To-dos:
1. Adjust the bug at AddCart - reset the amount.
2. Remove alerts from Payment + change input types of date and card
3. Finish the account view.
4. Add date field at the checkout for more pleasent look.

## IMPORTANT:
1. I used an index on the email row of the user database for faster access, that's why it's OK not to use an index
2. You MUST follow the setup instructions in order for it to work.
